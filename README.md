## ‚öôÔ∏è Razorpay Setup

Before setting up the Razorpay dummy payment system:  

1. Create your own Razorpay **key_id** and **key_secret** from the Razorpay Dashboard.  
2. Replace them in `server.js`:  

   ```js
   const razorpay = new Razorpay({
     key_id: 'rzp_test_btop9zW7LAr6UC',
     key_secret: 'FYMersDitnfb0lORO9bm4zqs'
   });
#üëâ Replace both values with your test keys.

#Run the server locally:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
Use ngrok to expose your local server:

bash
Copy code
ngrok http 3000
This will give you a valid HTTPS link for your locally running app.
Use this link to configure Razorpay‚Äôs test checkout and callbacks.
